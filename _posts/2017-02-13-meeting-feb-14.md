A reminder that we will be having a club meeting in CC2 tomorrow.  It will be a really fun meeting, where we will be focusing on 3D printing.  In order for you to participate tomorrow, you will need to download SketchUp.  You can download the software from the Managed Software Center application on your school computer.
