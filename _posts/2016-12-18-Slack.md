The Upper Canada College Engineering Society is now using Slack.  Slack has many features that will allow us to stay organized and to be more productive.  Using Slack will also mean that it can reduce the Gmail "chatter".
<br />
#### How to join:  
<br />
	1. You should receive an email from Michael or Simon asking you to join the UCC Engineers Without Borders organization.
<br />
	*Note: If you do not receive an invitation from Michael or Simon, please email them.* 
<br />
	2. Click the link and follow the prompts to create an account.
<br />
	3. You should automatically be added into the "announcements" and "random" group.
