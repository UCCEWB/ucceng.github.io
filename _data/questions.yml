  name: About Our Club
  description: The Engineers Without Borders club offers valuable skills that would be applicable in the real world.  The purpose of the club is to inspire students to innovate and create in groups, that are interesting but need guidance.  In this club, you are assisted by the help of University of Toronto Alumni who act as mentors.  At the end of the year, the projects are presented in front of a panel of judges to receive feedback on the work and to possibly be selected for awards.  The EWB program would be very beneficial towards the creativity of the students.  Everything taught at the EWB club and U of T programs would help students with innovation and marketing in the real world.  The program will help students beyond UCC.  This year Mr. MacDougall, will be our club advisor.

You MUST attend 3 lectures at U of T on weekends and stay in communication with your group members and mentor to organize weekly meetings. You must have your project completed by March break and will eventually present your idea in front of a panel of judges at U of T and will be marked and given awards on  creativity, presentation skills, feasibility and justification of the solution.

  description: 2 day conference in second or third week of May at U of T (most likely on a weekend). Will consist of many speakers and workshops. Accommodation at U of T residences is available but is optional. The topics covered in the conference will be society and technology. We would like as many people as possible to come out to the conference because it will cover a lot of relevant issues in our modern-day lives that we simply donâ€™t cover at school.

  description: UTHSDC engineering competition - held in March for grades 7-8 (Y1s can participate). It is a one-day engineering design competition that will be a lot of fun and has free food! You will get into groups of 3-5 and will develop a new and innovative design project and will win small prizes if your project is good enough! You will also get to meet with incredibly knowledgeable U of T students in the engineering program and they will be happy to answer any of your questions/comments/concerns about engineering! It will be a great experience! Some of the older guys went to a similar event hosted for high-school students in late October and loved it! No prep required - just be sure to come to club meetings!
