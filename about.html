              The Engineers Without Borders club offers valuable skills that would be applicable in the real world.  The purpose of the club is to inspire students to innovate and create in groups, that are intresting but need guidance.  In this club, you are assisted by the help of University of Toronto Alumni who act as mentors.  At the end of the year, the projects are presented in front of a panel of judges to recieve feedback on the work and to possibly be selected for awards.  The EWB program would be very benifical towards the creativity of the students.  Everything taught at the EWB club and U of T programs would help students with innovation and marketing in the real world.  The program will help students beyond UCC.
